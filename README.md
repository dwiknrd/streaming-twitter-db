# Streaming Twitter Tweets and Create a Database using Python and SQLite3
<hr>

## üí† &nbsp;Introduction
Data engineers gather the unstructured or semi-structured data from various sources and store them in a structured format in databases. We prepare the data for model building required by the data scientists. 
In this project I will work with a project of analysing streaming tweets. From extracting data from the source and storing it into a database to processing that data and preparing it for analysis tasks. **Through this project I will try to understand the workflow of a data engineer's task.**

## üì¢ &nbsp;Audiences
For data engineer who want to create structured data from humungous data (has lots of insights and hidden stored within it) for data scientist needed. 

## ‚úÖ &nbsp;What to Achieve
Every domain from stock markets and social media platform to IoT devices are producing thousand of rows of data in a matter of seconds. But, often this data is of immense importance in real-time. This streamed data can either be analysed in real-time or can be stored and analysed later. Therefore, it becomes imperative for every data scientist to understand how to handle real-time or streaming data. And what better streaming data than Twitter which produces millions of Tweets every hour.<br>
Twitter is a treasure trove of data. We can extract information from this. **If we can analyse streaming tweets we can understand the feelings of the people about events happening in the present. Business can leverage this information about how the public is reacting to their product. Investors can determine how a stock is going to perform** and so much more.

## üìù &nbsp;The Plan
1. Create a SQLite3 databse through Google Cloud Platform (GCP),
2. Send python code request to Twitter API
3. Receive tweets on Covid-19
4. Store information from tweets into database
5. Quesry from database and store into pandas DataFrame
6. Determine people's sentiment about a disease that has disrupted our lives in an unprecedented way. Also determine what hashtags are being used by people, which keywords are being used, and more.
